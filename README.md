# University-Projects

Dear reader,  
in this repository, you can find all the links to the projects I developed for my exams during my bachelor's and master's degrees, together with a short description. Almost all of them were done in a team with colleagues and friends.  
I hope this information is useful to you, thank you for your time,  
Silvia del Piano.


### Bachelor's Degree 

This degree was taught is Italian.   

#### **Sistemi Operativi** (Operating Systems)

*Taught by Prof. Giorgio Grisetti*    
 
This project was developed with Giacomo Acitelli and Alessio Devoto.   
We built a system to monitor a plant made of two parts: a PC client and an avr ATmega2560 microcontroller. We attached a temperature, light, and humidity sensor to this board to collect data. With the client, the user can interact with the board from the command line and request the data that is being measured by the sensors. In any case, measures are periodically taken by the microcontroller and logged on the shell.

This is the repository of the code, written in C: [PlantGuardian repository](https://github.com/giacomo1096/ProgettoOS.git).   
More information can be found on the PDF report of the project: [PlantGuardian report](https://github.com/giacomo1096/ProgettoOS/blob/master/so_report.pdf).



#### **Thesis**

*Supervisor: Prof. Roberto Beraldi*    

The main idea of the project was to build a SaaS web application to support high school students. Students, teachers, and parents can register, and useful information (teaching material, events, and posts made by the teachers) can be visualized in a personalized dashboard.   
It was developed with the Model-View-Controller pattern, implemented in Ruby on Rails. The process was carried out following the Agile methodology, together with a Behaviour-Driven-Development and Test-Driven-Development approach. The application uses Google OAuth and Google Drive as external services.   
For more details, refer to the code repository, which contains a short but more detailed description of this work, or to the thesis' PDF for a more in-depth reading.
