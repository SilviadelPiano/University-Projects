# University-Projects

Dear reader,  
in this repository, you can find all the links to the projects I developed for my exams during my bachelor's and master's degrees, together with a short description. Almost all of them were done in a team with colleagues and friends.  
I hope this information is useful to you, thank you for your time,  
Silvia del Piano.


### Bachelor's Degree 

This degree was taught is Italian.   

#### **Sistemi Operativi** (Operating Systems)

*Taught by Prof. Giorgio Grisetti*    
 
This project was developed with Giacomo Acitelli and Alessio Devoto.    

We built a system to monitor a plant made of two parts: a PC client and an avr ATmega2560 microcontroller. We attached a temperature, light, and humidity sensor to this board to collect data. With the client, the user can interact with the board from the command line and request the data that is being measured by the sensors. In any case, measures are periodically taken by the microcontroller and logged on the shell.

This is the repository of the code, written in C: [PlantGuardian repository](https://github.com/giacomo1096/ProgettoOS.git).   
More information can be found on the PDF report of the project: [PlantGuardian report](https://github.com/giacomo1096/ProgettoOS/blob/master/so_report.pdf).



#### **Thesis**

*Supervisor: Prof. Roberto Beraldi*    

The main idea of the project was to build a SaaS web application to support high school students. Students, teachers, and parents can register, and useful information (teaching material, events, and posts made by the teachers) can be visualized in a personalized dashboard.   
It was developed with the Model-View-Controller pattern, implemented in Ruby on Rails. The process was carried out following the Agile methodology, together with a Behaviour-Driven-Development and Test-Driven-Development approach. The application uses Google OAuth and Google Drive as external services.   
For more details, refer to the code repository, which contains a short but more detailed description of this work, or to the thesis' PDF for a more in-depth reading.

### Master's Degree  
  
  
#### **Machine Learning**

*Taught by Prof. Fabio Patrizi*

In this course we were taught the basic theory and techniques of machine learning. We had to deliver two homeworks: in the first one, we had to work on malware detection using different classifiers (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine with kernel method, Decision Tree, Random Forest), while in the second one we did image classification comparing LeNet and AlexNet neural networks models. Both the classifiers and the neural networks were compared using the metrics of precision, recall, F1-score and accuracy, considering the overall performance.   

These are the Jupyter notebooks with the code: 
- [Homwork 1 notebook](https://github.com/SilviadelPiano/University-Projects/blob/main/Homework1.ipynb)
- [Homework 2 notebook](https://github.com/SilviadelPiano/University-Projects/blob/main/Homework2.ipynb)

These are the reports: 
- [Homework 1 report](https://github.com/SilviadelPiano/University-Projects/blob/main/ML_Homework_1_report.pdf)
- [Homework 2 report](https://github.com/SilviadelPiano/University-Projects/blob/main/ML_Homework_2_report.pdf)


#### **Internet of Things** 

*Taught by Prof. Andrea Vitaletti and Prof. Ioannis Chatzigiannakis*

During this course, we had to complete four individual assignments and one big group project. For each homework, we were required to make a post on Hackster.io and a video on Youtube (the links are in the corresponding repositories).   
Since the documentation is quite complete, I'll directly leave the links to the pages containing the code.   

Individual assignments:   

- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/AssignmentsIoT/Assignment1_IoT.git)
- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/AssignmentsIoT/Assignment2_IoT.git)
- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/AssignmentsIoT/Assignment3_IoT.git)
- [Assignment 4](https://github.com/AssignmentsIoT/Assignment4IoT.git)

The group project was developed with Gianmarco Zizzo and Stefano Foti, and it's one of the works I'm proudest of.

#### **Bioinformatics and Network Medicine**

*Taught by Prof. Paolo Tieri and  Prof. Manuela Petti*

This project was developed with Marie Piquet and Svenja Jedhoff.   

In this project, we applied network medicine techniques to study stomach neoplasms. This is the abstract of the report we wrote: it summarizes quite well the objective of this work and the tools used:   

*Stomach neoplasms are nowadays, together with other cancers, still one of the major causes of death worldwide.
Due to this reason, the objective of this study is to identify genes that may be connected to this family of cancers,
to improve our understanding of this disease and its treatment. This work utilises network medicine techniques on
data gathered from the biological databases BioGRID and DisGeNET to build a protein-protein-interaction network
with genes which are known to be associated with stomach neoplasm. Afterwards, to predict putative disease
genes, 5-fold cross-validation is used for a performance evaluation of three algorithms: DIAMOnD, DiaBLE, and
heat-diffusion. The putative disease genes identified show a higher degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality
than average, strongly suggesting a central role in the network. Using the databases of GO and KEGG, an
enrichment analysis is executed with the web-platform EnrichR on the first 200 putative disease genes provided
by the best performing algorithm. However, its results suggest that the identified putative disease genes are not
involved in the disease. Finally, the drug repurposing possibility is investigated, using the first 20 putative disease
genes. The drugs Selumetinib, Tanespimy and Trametinib could be identified. According to ClinicalTrials.gov,
Selumetinib has not been involved in studies regarding stomach neoplasms yet. Nonetheless, it was found that the
drug Tanespimycin has been in clinical trials but no results have been published and that the drug Trametinib is
involved in two ongoing clinical trials for the disease of stomach neoplasm.*   

The complete report is this: [BNM report](https://github.com/SilviadelPiano/University-Projects/blob/main/BMN_proj_group_10.pdf). It was written using the Google Docs template provided by the professors.   

In the corresponding .zip folder it's possible to find the code and other material used.


#### **Process Management and Mining**

*Taught by Prof. Andrea Marrella*

This project is almost finished. I've been developing it with Jessica Brandi and Gianluca Circelli.  

It follows a business process lifecycle: designing the BMPN model, analyzing it, performing simulation and execution with Bizagi Modeler and Bizagi Studio, exploring the opportunities of RPA (Robotic Process Automation) with UiPath and doing process mining with tools like ProM and similar.   
As soon as it's finished, more information on it will be provided.

#### **Mobile Application and Cloud Computing**   

*Taught by Prof. Roberto Beraldi*   

This project has to be started yet.   


#### **Thesis**  

Coming soon!
