# University-Projects

Dear reader,  
in this repository, you can find all the links to the projects I developed for my exams during my bachelor's and master's degrees, together with a short description. Almost all of them were done in a team with colleagues and friends.  
I hope this information is useful to you, thank you for your time,  
Silvia del Piano.


### Bachelor's Degree 

This degree was taught is Italian.   

##### **Sistemi Operativi** (Operating Systems)

*Taught by Prof. Giorgio Grisetti*  
This project was developed with Giacomo Acitelli and Alessio Devoto.   
We built a system to monitor a plant made of two parts: a PC client and an avr ATmega2560 microcontroller. We attached a temperature, light, and humidity sensor to this board to collect data. With the client, the user can interact with the board from the command line and request the data that is being measured by the sensors. In any case, measures are periodically taken by the microcontroller and logged on the shell.

This is the repository of the code, written in C: [PlantGuardian repository](https://github.com/giacomo1096/ProgettoOS.git).
More information can be found on the PDF report of the project: [PlantGuardian report](https://github.com/giacomo1096/ProgettoOS/blob/master/so_report.pdf).
